# Jet 

**Jet** is a dependency-free, fixed-function 3D software rasteriser written in
C++17. It targets embedded hardware with limited CPU and memory, including
ESP32 and STM32, and also runs on desktop PCs and Raspberry Pi.

Jet uses integer arithmetic in the rasterisation hot path and native 16-bit
RGB565 colour for output to embedded displays. It supports flat-shaded, lit
and textured geometry for low-poly games and visualisations.

On an ESP32-S3, Jet achieves **up to 100k tris/sec** in the
[tropical island example](https://github.com/CubeCoders/JetExamples/blob/main/esp32-tropical-island/VALIDATION.md).
This measures rasterized triangles over render time, excluding display scanout
and frame pacing. Throughput varies with scene complexity, triangle size and
enabled rendering features.

See the [ESP32 optimisation measurements](docs/ESP32Performance.md) for exact
indexed-texture results, memory costs and supported sampling paths.

### Experimental tiled megatextures

The [ESP32-S3 megatexture demo](https://github.com/CubeCoders/JetMegatexturesDemo)
adapts James D. Lambert's N64 chapel using paletted tiled textures and an
application-managed cache of bilinear samples. Jet supplies opt-in tiled views,
nearest/bilinear/three-point/cached sampling and adaptive perspective spans.
See [the API contract and limitations](docs/TiledTextures.md).


## Feature highlights

Compile-time switches in `JetConfig.hpp` let you disable features to reduce
CPU, RAM and flash usage. See [`src/JetConfig.example.hpp`](src/JetConfig.example.hpp)
for the available options.

### Rendering

- Triangle and quad meshes with per-face material assignment.
- Opt-in [shared mesh instancing](docs/instancing.md) to reduce repeated geometry
  storage, with independent placements and material overrides.
- Flat, Gouraud, Phong and wireframe shading modes (per material).
- Affine and perspective-correct texture mapping; optional bilinear filtering.
- Optional Z-buffering, or painter's-algorithm sorting (per-object and/or
  per-triangle). `Object::preciseDepthSort` refines occupied painter buckets by
  triangle mean depth for overlapping parts, without a depth allocation. It is
  opt-in and does not resolve intersecting/cyclic polygons.
- Optional `JET_PERSPECTIVE_DEPTH` reciprocal-Z interpolation for desktop depth
  accuracy on large sloping faces (`Z_BUFFERING=1`, `FAST_Z=0`). It adds a pixel
  division and defaults off.
- Backface and frontface culling, depth bias for decals and shadows, per-object
  blend modes (replace, add, subtract, multiply, average, XOR).
- Screen-door alpha and noise-based dithering for transparency.
- Per-object distance-based fading to reduce LOD popping and
  scene-wide depth fog.
- Half-width framebuffers, interlaced field buffers and checkerboard rendering
  with optional reconstruction.
- **`WATER_REFLECT` shading mode**: animated screen-space water surface.
  Reflects the background sky gradient about a camera-pitch-correct waterline,
  with per-material ripple amplitude (`specular`) and vertical bias
  (`waterYBias`). Blended toward a flat tint by `material->alpha`.
- **`ADDITIVE` shading mode**: saturating-add blend (src × alpha + dst)
  for emissive effects such as neon signs and explosion halos.
- **`SSR_FIELD_REFLECT`**: when `FIELD_BUFFERS` is active, `WATER_REFLECT`
  samples mirror pixels from the *previous* committed field buffer so
  reflections avoid draw-order dependencies across parallel rendering bands.
- Perspective-correct Phong normal interpolation.

### Lighting

- Ambient and directional lights with Flat, Gouraud or Phong shading.
- Optional `Z_BRIGHTNESS` depth darkening.

### Post-FX

- Effects without an extra buffer: CRT scanlines, cell-shading.
- Buffered effects (large-RAM targets): FXAA, bloom, motion blur,
  chromatic aberration, pixelation.

### Tooling

- `Primitives::create*` helpers for cubes, spheres, cylinders, capsules,
  pyramids, grids, planes, quads and billboards.
- Minimal Wavefront `.obj` loader.
- Optional screen-space picking (compile-time bounded; zero cost when set to
  0). Returns the closest hit object, triangle index, depth and snapped pixel
  coordinate.
- Animated palette textures: `Texture::advancePalette(dt, fps)` cycles the
  palette offset by `dt × fps` entries per call; no-op when `paletteSize` is 0.
- Custom shader entry point for extending the fixed-function pipeline.

### 2D Sprites

`Sprite2D` draws overlays after `render()`. It supports textured or solid-colour
fills, colour-key transparency, alpha and additive blending, integer upscaling,
and `zOrder`-based draw order. On `HALF_WIDTH_BUFFERS` builds, sprites are
composited at full output resolution during display scanout.

Display integrations can call `Renderer::compositeSprites(line, width, y,
sprites, count, swapDestination)` from `Sprite2D.hpp` to blend one RGB565 output
row. Pass `true` for byte-swapped panel buffers, or leave it `false` for native
RGB565. The helper clips to the row width, allocates nothing and paints in the
supplied order; sort by `zOrder` before scanout and keep sprite, material and
texture storage stable until it finishes. It has no ESP32 dependencies.

Set `textureFlags` to `Sprite2D::FLIP_X` and/or `FLIP_Y` to flip an image.
`MIRROR_X` and `MIRROR_Y` append reflected halves: combining both draws a
32×32 top-left quarter as a symmetric 64×64 sprite, using one quarter of
the texture storage. Mirroring preserves integer scaling and colour-key
transparency without extra sprite instances.

### Particles

`ParticleSystem` uses a fixed pool and renders through the rasteriser after
`scene->render()`. It includes spark and water-splash emitters, distance
culling, and configurable emitter counts and particle lifetimes.

### Lens flare

`LensFlare` projects a directional light source to screen space and positions
a sprite chain along the axis between the sun and screen centre. Fade speed,
per-element axis offset (`axisT`), alpha, blend mode and integer scale are
configurable. It can use a pick slot for sun occlusion testing; with
`MAX_PICK_QUERIES = 0`, the sun is treated as unobstructed.

## Getting started

Your application provides the framebuffer, display driver and main loop.
Add Jet as a CMake subdirectory or ESP-IDF component, provide a
`JetConfig.hpp` on your include path (copy and customise
`src/JetConfig.example.hpp`), then call `scene->render()` once per frame.

For ESP-IDF, depend on it as you would any other component:

```yaml
# main/idf_component.yml
dependencies:
  jet: "*"
```

### Minimal example

Allocate colour and depth buffers, add a camera, lights and a cube, then
render each frame:

```cpp
#include "Jet.hpp"
using namespace Renderer;

// 320x240 RGB565 colour buffer + matching Z-buffer.
constexpr int W = 320, H = 240;
uint16_t color[W * H];
uint16_t depth[ZBUFFER_STRIDE(W) * H];

int main() {
    Scene  scene(color, depth, W, H);
    scene.setBackcolor(0x0000);          // RGB565 clear colour (black)
    scene.setClearBuffer(true);

    Camera camera;
    camera.setPosition(0, 0, -500);      // world units
    camera.setFOV(75, W);
    camera.nearPlane = 16;
    camera.farPlane  = 8192;
    scene.setCamera(&camera);

    DirectionalLight sun(Vector3{45, 35, 0}, Color{255, 245, 220}, 220);
    AmbientLight     amb(Color{40, 48, 64});
    scene.setDirectionalLight(&sun);
    scene.setAmbientLight(&amb);

    Material red(0xF800);                // RGB565: bright red
    red.shadingMode = ShadingMode::GOURAUD;

    Object* cube = Primitives::createCube(200, 200, 200, &red);
    cube->setPosition(0, 0, 200);
    scene.addObject(cube);

    // Per-frame: rotate, render, push the buffer to your display.
    for (;;) {
        cube->rotate(0, 1, 0);           // 1 degree per frame around Y
        scene.render();                  // colour buffer now contains the frame
        // pushToDisplay(color, W, H);   // <-- you provide this
    }
}
```
